# `tree`

## Description
The [`ls`](ls.md) command is not the only one that allows you to list directory contents, but it is the most commonly used. Another really useful command is the `tree` command.
The `tree` command allows you to list directory contents in a tree-like format. Without parameters, it lists the contents of the current directory.

## Usage
```shell
tree [options] <path>
```

---

## Options
#### `-a`
Display all the files, with the hidden

## Remarks
+ I personally use a feature of my [`ls`](ls.md) provider `lsd` so I don't use tree with its options.
