# EP2. What is a Switch?

Connect computer of a same network.
They can now talk with each other
They have a number of ports, the number of pc we can connect to the switch

#### Ethernet Cables
Computers talk via signals, and signals are transmitted to the switch through the wires 

Switch vs Hub : switch is smart, not the hub
The hub doesn't target, it diffuse the requests to all of the ports

#### Ping
just test the status of a computer
Target the IP address
